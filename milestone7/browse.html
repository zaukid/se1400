                    <span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="more"> Take
                    						five minutes to learn the rules and set the game up.
                    						Then let the grey matter get its workout in. A good memory is helpful, but to win you'll need to
                    						plan ahead and make a few good strategic moves. Impress yourself and your friends by reciting a
                    						long list of random words. Or forget a single word and watch your hand grow and your mind
                    						shrivel. Players hold word cards in their hands which are played alphabetically as play
                    						proceeds. Each time a player adds to the string of previously played cards, he must recite the
                    						words on the cards beneath the one he's playing. But hold on! Words are not just alphabetical by
                    						their first letter. They can also be played if their word contains a double of the active
                    						letter. For example, if F is the active letter, FOGGY can be played, but so can CAFFEINE.
                    						Players who fail to correctly recite the word stack add any unrecited words to their own hands.
                    						Word Crush outcomes can become unpredictable and frustrating. Best laid plans can be laid to
                    						waste in a moment. One forgotten or misremembered word cam mean inevitable defeat.
                    						Extraordinarily competitive games can built word lists that cycle through the entire alphabet, and then some. When you win a game of Word Crush, you'll leave feeling like it was all you. Lady Luck had nothing to do with it.

                    						game with none of the

                    						all complete against the roller. The rules are simple. After the roller's first two-dice roll,
                    						the other players wager whether his second roll will be higher or lower than his first. Winners
                    						are always paid what they wagered, and may change their bets right up to the moment the dice are
                    						rolled. If the roller throws two equal rolls, he wins instead and gets all the chips on the
                    						board. Play continues for a predetermined number of rounds, minutes, or maximum chip value. Die
                    						Caster is entertaining but easy to learn for young and old alike. Children are introduced to the
                    						concept of two dice roll probability. Trailing players are never truly out until they complete
                    						their final rolls. Lead changes can happen rapidly and unexpectedly! Get Die Caster for your
                    						game closet, but keep it on top! It takes only a minute or two to refreshen the rules if it's
                    						been a while since you last played. It's the perfect game for family gatherings or game nights
                    						with friends. Younger children can participate with minimal help from older siblings or
                    						parents.
